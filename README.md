A simple wildcard DNS inspired by [xip.io](http://xip.io/)

```bash
        10.0.0.1.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.1
    www.10.0.0.2.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.2
    foo.10.0.0.3.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.3
bar.baz.10.0.0.4.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.4

        10-0-0-5.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.5
    www.10-0-0-6.xip.name  resolves to  10.0.0.6
```

## How does it work?

xip.name runs a custom Domain Name Server which extracts any IP address found
in the requested domain name and sends it back in the response.

## Does it cost anything to use xip.name?

No, but you are welcome to donate if you find the service useful.

## Credits

xip.name is built on top of [Miek](http://miek.nl)â€™s lovely [dns package](https://github.com/miekg/dns) for Go.

Lars Wilhelmsen made some tiny improvements and added a Dockerfile to produce
an Alpine-based image hosting xip and website (on nginx) + support for
configurating xip via environment variables.
